            The Quidditch Tournament is the heart-pounding, sky-soaring
            highlight of every wizarding year. With players on broomsticks
            darting across the pitch, chasing the elusive Golden Snitch, it’s a
            spectacle that blends strategy, skill, and pure adrenaline.
            <br /><br />
            Teams from every house come together, showcasing their talent,
            teamwork, and undying determination. The roar of the crowd echoes
            through the grounds as Chasers score, Beaters defend, and Seekers
            hunt for victory.
            <br /><br />
            More than just a game, the Quidditch Tournament fosters house pride,
            unity, and unforgettable moments. From daring dives to match-winning
            catches, it’s a celebration of wizarding sport at its finest.
            <br /><br />
            Join the excitement, cheer for your house, and witness the magic
            unfold on the legendary Quidditch pitch.

            The Yule Ball is a magical celebration of elegance, music, and
            camaraderie that takes place during the festive season at Hogwarts.
            Draped in shimmering decorations and illuminated by floating lights,
            the Great Hall transforms into a dazzling ballroom.
            <br /><br />
            Students from every house dress in their finest robes, ready to
            dance the night away to enchanting melodies played by wizarding
            orchestras. Beyond the music and dancing, the Yule Ball symbolizes
            unity and friendship as students set aside house rivalries for an
            unforgettable evening.
            <br /><br />
            From graceful waltzes to joyful laughter, the Yule Ball creates
            memories that linger long after the music fades. It's a night of
            wonder, where magic and elegance intertwine under the starlit
            ceiling.
